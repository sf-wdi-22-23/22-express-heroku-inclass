## In-class Work

Thanks for working together in class! We know it was a little too fast for some and a little too slow for others. Hopefully it was at least slightly useful for everyone.

The purpose of this repo is to make sure you have a reference for the first small steps we took in class.

My working project is [here](https://fierce-castle-2022.herokuapp.com/) and I will probably make additional changes during the week and possibly into the future, in order to make it at least somewhat useful. If so, I will prepend the latest changes to this README.md file.

### Next Steps:

Please start from scratch by cloning the [express-heroku-starter repo](https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/express_heroku_starter) and follow the instructions there. This is here for your reference.

A few steps not included in the starter project README include:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm install bcryptjs --save`
3. For local development, fire up `mongod` before running `nodemon`

I'm sure there were others. Feel free to Slack me with reminders and I will update the README.md
